Requirements to build a conda-forge package:

```text
    gobject-introspection =1.78.1
    gsl =2.7
    pygobject
    python >=3.8,<3.12
```

NOTE: `gobject-introspection =1.64` is available on conda-forge for py36-py38.
To get later versions and use contemporary Python versions, need to build these
somewhere else than GitHub Actions workflows.
