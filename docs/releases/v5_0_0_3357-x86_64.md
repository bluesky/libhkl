architecture | x86_64
OS | debian:bullseye
`gobject-introspection` | 1.78.1 (built from source)
`libgsl-dev` | 2.7 (built from source)

Requirements to build a conda-forge package:

```text
    gobject-introspection =1.78.1
    gsl =2.7
    pygobject
    python >=3.8,<3.12
```

NOTE: The specific versions of `gobject-introspection` and `gsl` are limited by
what is available on conda-forge for the target versions of Python and what is
available for the compiler to build the library. To get later versions and use
contemporary Python versions, need to build these somewhere else than GitHub
Actions workflows.
