Packaging requirements to build a conda-forge package with this library:

```text
    gobject-introspection
    gsl==2.6 
    libcblas
    pygobject
```

NOTE!! conda-forge::gsl 2.6 installs as libgsl.so.25

NOTE: The specific versions of `gobject-introspection` and `gsl` are limited by
what is available on conda-forge for the target versions of Python and what is
available for the compiler to build the library. To get later versions and use
contemporary Python versions, need to build these somewhere else than GitHub
Actions workflows.
